# Software vulnerabilities
Software vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain access to a system,
the data of the database or attack the network or other systems connected to this
system. There are four general vulnerability categories that software has:
1. Memory management vulnerabilities
2. Structured output vulnerablities
3. Race condition vulnerabilities
4. Side-channel vulnerabilities

The generic vulnerabilities can have many real-life examples and can have different approaches. For example with the structured output, we know SQL-injection, but also path traversal or command-line injection. Do not think that having only four general vulnerabilities, it is easy to create secure software. It still relies on expertise and know what you are doing.
