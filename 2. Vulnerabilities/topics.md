# Additional Teaching Topics
## 1. Safety Considerations

1. Isolated Environment: Always run these demonstrations in isolated VMs or containers
2. No Real Data: Never use real passwords, user data, or production systems
3. Clear Disclaimers: Emphasize these are for educational purposes only
4. Ethical Guidelines: Discuss responsible disclosure and legal implications

## 2. Enhanced Learning Activities

1. Have students fix the vulnerable code
2. Create coding challenges with hidden vulnerabilities
3. Use static analysis tools to detect issues
4. Implement automated tests for security

## 3. Tools to Complement Demos

1. Memory: Valgrind, AddressSanitizer, Dr. Memory
2. Static Analysis: Cppcheck, Clang Static Analyzer, Bandit (Python)
3. Dynamic Testing: Fuzzing tools (AFL, libFuzzer)
4. Network: Wireshark, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP

## 4. Real-World Context

1. Discuss CVE examples for each vulnerability type
2. Show how these vulnerabilities appear in popular software
3. Explain the business impact of security breaches
4. Cover secure development lifecycle practices

## 5. Assessment Ideas

1. Code review exercises
2. Vulnerability identification quizzes
3. Secure coding assignments
4. Penetration testing scenarios (controlled environment)

## 6. Extension Topics

1. Mitigation techniques (ASLR, DEP, stack canaries)
2. Secure coding standards (CERT, OWASP)
3. Security testing methodologies
4. Threat modeling exercises
