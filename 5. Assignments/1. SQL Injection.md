_Maurice Snoeren, 10 November 2022_

SQL injection is one of the main attack vectors of web applications. In fact, any injection is a major concern for application developers. When user input is used to communicate with the OS (commandline), SQL database or reading files on the disk, the use is able to inject other commands to change the functionality. It is even possible to get secrets from a computer system. In this assignment, you will investigate SQL injection.
