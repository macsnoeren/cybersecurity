# Cryptography
Cryptography is used to secure information and communication. It is used to perform a variety of actions. Obviously to encrypt the information you want to share. You can also think about signing the information you sent, so people know it is coming from you (non repudiation). Authentication and authorisation mechanism can be implemented with cryptography. Authentication is verifying the identity of a user or service, while authorisation determines the access rights of these users or services.

Cryptography uses a lot of different technologies. Implementation of functionality that adds security, mostly it combines different technologies. There

Topics that are important in this case are:
- Secure hashing
- Symmetric cryptography
- Asymmetric cryptography
- Creating keys (random sources)
- Creating keys from passwords (user input)
- Exchanging keys
- Storing encryption keys
- Storing passwords for user management
- Communication of keys and encrypted test (base64)
- Secret sharing (or secret splitting)
- Zero knowledge challenges

Real technologies:
- How does TLS work?
- How does PKI work?
- How does Blockchain work?
