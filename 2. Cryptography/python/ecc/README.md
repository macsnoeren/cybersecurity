# ECC

ECC can be used to create digital signatures or to perform a key exchange.

Compared to traditional algorithms like RSA, an ECC key is significantly smaller at the same security level. For instance, a 3072-bit RSA key takes 768 bytes whereas the equally strong NIST P-256 private key only takes 32 bytes (that is, 256 bits).
